# 🗺️ Resume Builder Implementation Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Overview

This roadmap outlines the phased implementation of a comprehensive resume building system for JobPilot-OpenManus, integrating key features from resume-lm with OpenManus agent capabilities for automated job applications.

**Vision**: Create the most intelligent resume building and job application system that leverages AI to optimize resumes for specific jobs and automate the application process.

## 📊 Implementation Strategy

### **Integration Approach**
- **Code Extraction**: Selective adaptation of resume-lm components to Solid.js
- **Data Model Harmonization**: Extend JobPilot's SQLAlchemy models with resume functionality
- **AI Enhancement**: Leverage OpenManus agents for intelligent resume optimization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build incrementally while maintaining system stability

### **Technology Considerations**
- **Frontend**: Convert React components to Solid.js with DaisyUI styling
- **Backend**: Extend FastAPI with resume management endpoints
- **AI Integration**: Use existing OpenManus LLM infrastructure
- **Database**: Extend current SQLAlchemy models with resume tables
