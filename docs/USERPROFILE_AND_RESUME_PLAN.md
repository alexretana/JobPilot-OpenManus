### ‚ùå What's Missing or Broken

#### Frontend Integration Issues

### üö® Things That Are Wrong and Need to Be Removed/Fixed

#### Resume API Issues
- **CRITICAL**: Resume API (`app/api/resume_api.py`) is using in-memory storage (`RESUMES_STORE`) instead of database
- **CRITICAL**: `get_resume_repository()` import is present but not properly used in most endpoints
- **ERROR**: Missing database session management in resume endpoints

#### Database Relationship Issues
- **TODO Comment**: `UserProfileDB` has placeholder comment for resume relationships (line 738)
- **Missing Import**: Circular import issue prevents proper relationship setup
- **Incomplete**: ResumeDB references UserProfileDB but relationship not established both ways

#### Frontend/Backend Mismatch
- **API Structure**: Resume Service expects different response format than Resume API provides
- **Model Differences**: Frontend ContactInfo model has different fields than backend
- **Endpoint Misalignment**: Some endpoints expected by frontend don't exist in backend
