      "original": "Led development of microservices architecture...",
      "alternative": "Architected scalable microservices platform...",
      "use_case": "For roles emphasizing architecture skills"
    }
  ],
  "missing_quantification_opportunities": [
    "Consider adding team size if you led other developers",
    "Include deployment frequency or release metrics if applicable"
  ]
}
```

## Key Principles
1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague terms like "helped," "assisted," "worked on"
2. **Show Impact**: Connect activities to business outcomes
3. **Use Numbers**: Quantify everything possible
4. **Match Keywords**: Incorporate relevant industry/job keywords naturally
5. **Vary Structure**: Use different sentence structures to avoid repetition
6. **Focus on Results**: Emphasize outcomes, not just activities
7. **Be Honest**: Base achievements on actual accomplishments

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Starting with weak verbs like "Responsible for" or "Duties included"
- Using passive voice instead of active voice
- Focusing on responsibilities instead of achievements
- Making claims that can't be substantiated
- Using the same action verb repeatedly
- Forgetting to include business context or impact
